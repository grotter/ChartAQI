# ChartAQI

A small graph built on [Chart.js](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js) to view your [ArduinoAQI](https://github.com/grotter/ArduinoAQI) sensor data and any optional PurpleAir sensors. The graph uses the following GET variables:

* `custom` - A comma-delimited collection of ThingSpeak sensor IDs and read API keys, e.g. custom=123|asdf,345|qwer
* `purpleair` (optional) - A comma-delimited collection of PurpleAir sensor IDs
* `results` (optional) - Number of results, defaults to 100
